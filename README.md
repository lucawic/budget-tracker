# budget-tracker

## Description
A progressive web application (PWA) is capable of having offline functionality by using indexedDB and service workers to allow the app functions to persist when not connected to a network. The goal of this Challenge from Module #19 is to implement PWA features into an existing budget tracking app. This would allow a user to add inputs offline, and then save these inputs to be updated later when once again connected to the web. 

AS AN avid traveler

SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling
