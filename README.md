# budget-tracker

## Description
A progressive web application (PWA) is capable of having offline functionality by using indexedDB and service workers to allow the app functions to persist when not connected to a network. The goal of this Challenge from Module #19 is to implement PWA features into an existing budget tracking app. This would allow a user to add inputs offline, and then save these inputs to be updated later when once again connected to the web. 

AS AN avid traveler
I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling
